            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Urbana Champaign studying computer science. I've always been
            interested computers and technology, and I started programming when I started high school, leading
            me to major in computer science. I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area, but also have strong connections
            to southeast Poland, where my parents are from and where the majority of my family still lives. I speak both English 
            and Polish, as well as Spanish. Apart from programming, I have strong interests in music and sports. I played both
            piano and percussion, and love almost every sport, with my favorites being basketball and soccer.</p>

            <img src="assets/unity_game.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%;">
            <p>Novascape is a 2D game built in Unity that focuses around a character stuck in a galaxy
            that soon could get destroyed. The character starts on one planet, and travels from planet to planet
            trying to get the necessary resources to build a spaceship and escape the galaxy. The game features procedural
            planet generation for all the planets, which includes resource allocations within the planets and cave generation.</p>

            <img src="assets/database_project.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%;">
            <p>The food database was an application built by starting with the Wikipedia dataset and extracting
            the food pages into our database. The user can search through all the foods in the database, and get
            relevant information such as where the food originates from and a link to the Wikipedia article for more information
            on the food. The application also features a recipe recommendation system using the user's search history and 
            parameters that the user can set, and a map as a visualization of the origins of all the food in the database.</p>

            <img src="assets/grade_project.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%;">
            <p>Grade.Me was built to be a better gradebook than the ones currently offered by the school. Grade.Me includes
            useful features not seen in other solutions for both professors and students. Grade.Me has a simple, integrated 
            design making it easy for a student to see all their grades in one place and an instructor to see in an easy glance
            how the class is doing. It also includes a grade predictor system for students, who can change future grades that
            have not happened yet to see how it impacts their grades. For instructors, it also includes a simple grade adjustment
            system, so that instructors can easily apply changes to the class and visually see how it changes the grades. Grade.Me
            focuses on data and visualization, and includes many graphs and statisitcs that students and instructors should expect 
            in a grade system.</p>
